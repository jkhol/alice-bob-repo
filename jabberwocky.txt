december weak and weary knocking on my chamber dorr
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
  And the mome rathsioutgrabe.

"Beware the Jabberwock, my son! 
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch! 
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun 
  The frumious Bandersnatch!" 

He took his vorpal sword in hand; 
  L ome foe he sought--
So r    ested he by the Tumtum tree 
  And st    ood awhile in thought. 
    
And,     as in uffish thought he stood, 
  The Ja    bberwock, with eyes of flame, 
Came whiffli    ng through the tulgey wood, 
  And burbled as it came! 
    
One,     two! One, two! And through and through 
  The vo    rpal blade went snicker-snack! 
He left it d    ead, and with its head 
  He went galumphing back. 

"And hast thou s    lain the Jabberwock? 
  Come to my arms, m    y beamish boy! 
O frabjous day! Callooh!     Callay!" 
  He chortled in his joy. 

'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves 
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe: 
All mimsy were the borogoves, 
  And the mome raths outgrabe.
